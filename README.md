# Search Component

This is a ridiculously trivial search component based on the [starter repo](https://circleci.com/gh/ericelliott/react-pure-component-starter) that janders223 used to create his [Shopping example](https://github.com/janders223/redux-graphql-shopping-cart). It includes a trivial search component with example usage and a test.

## Usage

npm install
npm start
```
